# Body Detect üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Goal:<br>
‚óè Learn the basics of face detection using Haar feature-based CascadeClassifiers.<br>
‚óè Write a code to detect face on images.<br>
‚óè Write a code to detect faces on each frame of videos from the webcam.<br>
<br>
Face Detection detects the presence of a face in an image. However if you want to identify the face with
pre-stored images then we would write a code that compares the detected image of a face. This process is known as face recognition.
